		If you want to implement a feature like "You will lose your data, are you sure 
		you want to leave?" in Angular, there are two ways. The first one that comes to 
		mind is to use guards. The benefit is that you can customize your dialog box. The 
		downside, and a big one, is that it won't be triggered if you have an external 
		redirection or if you close the browser or the tab. Therefore, you have the 
		beforeunload event in JavaScript. It triggers the system dialog "if you leave, 
		you will lose your data". It's not the best-looking dialog, but there is a clear 
		reason why you can't customize it. If you could, then you could block a user 
		from leaving or closing your website by never letting them give the option to 
		close the dialog. Nevertheless, it's not always used on the web. GitHub, for 
		example, sometimes uses it, sometimes not.

		page. So when you type http://user.github.io/project/any-other-page, GitHub 
		doesn't recognize this page because it serves only the index.html. Therefore, when 
		it doesn't know the URL, it redirects to the 404.html page. The trick is to 
		duplicate your index.html and name it also 404.html. Then Angular can manage

		As a developer, I've found it really helpful to pay attention to the user experience

		sometimes I'm surprised that developers tend to reinvent the wheel instead of simply 
		checking out the best websites and seeing how they do things, especially for the 
		frontend part (which is mostly open source), or at least how fast their websites load.
		Also, we sometimes overlook poor website performance. We get used to it and never 
		really ask ourselves, "Should it be that slow?" So, my advice is to always compare 
		your website with the best in class and pay attention to details like how fast 
		a button loads, which HTTP headers they use, how many endpoints they call, and 
		what kind of caching they implement. Even if you don't know everything, this skill

		Continuous delivery has a superpower: it reveals many flaws in your process if you 
		don't use it. For example, if you haven't automated migration files in your project, 
		then you can't implement continuous delivery because it requires automatically 
		deploying your websites, which needs scripts. Another point is that when you deploy 
		multiple times per day, it means you need to have high stability. In the old days, 
		this stability wasn't really there and was covered by multiple environments and 
		manual testers to have high confidence in the next planned release. To gain this 
		stability, you need to have a well-tested application, both frontend and backend. 
		Some teams achieve it only with unit tests and contract testing. They really 
		avoid end-to-end testing because they consider it too expensive and still 
		achieve high confidence with only unit and contract testing. Another important 
		aspect of continuous delivery is using feature flags. They allow you to deploy 
		new features that stay invisible to the user. Then, when everyone thinks it's 
		really ready to be shown to others, the flag is activated.

		all of them need to be upgraded before yours is upgraded. Since Angular libraries 
		tend to be less popular, they can die out fast. With JavaScript libraries, you
